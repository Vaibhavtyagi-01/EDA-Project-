Since I am a huge fan of cars, I got a very beautiful data-set of cars from Kaggle. The data-set
can be downloaded from here. To give a piece of brief information about the data set this data
contains more of 10, 000 rows and more than 10 columns which contains features of the car such
as Engine Fuel Type, Engine HP, Transmission Type, highway MPG, city MPG and many more.
So in this tutorial, we will explore the data and make it ready for modeling.
